I am a software developer residing in Salem NH. I got my bachelors of science in Business Administration at the University of New Hampshire, with a minor in Computer Science. I feel in love with software development during my undergraduate, and decided to stay on and get my masters in Computer Science at the same school. I am always open to new opportunities, both geographically and in my career. 

Personally, I got married in July of 2017, and my interests involve music and sports. I play three instruments, was part of a college a cappella group, and I am an avid bowler and ultimate frisbee player.
